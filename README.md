# Portfolio
## Purpose
The purpose of this portfolio is to create a employee competitive presence on the web. A place to display my projects and contact information for potential employers to see and reach out, and hopefully lead to employment.

## Description
A web portfolio, with a basic bio, projects and contact info. i based the basic structure off my previous [portfolio](https://github.com/dcornnell/dcornnell.github.io) from 2015. I tried to maintain the layout and ability to change the basic color scheme with the buttons on the bottom. I updated the code using current knowledge and skills and well as the projects and bio info. 

## Technologies Used
-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript
-Jquery

## Future Improvements
- [ ]Move style changes to Objects to dry out the javascript code
- [ ]Create a constructor function to create "projects" and then add them to The dom from an external file so the index.html doesn't contain so much code.
- [ ]Move this site to a custom host or at least to the basic dcornnell.github.io page.
